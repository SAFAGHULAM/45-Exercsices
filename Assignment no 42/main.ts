//Assignment no 42
//Great Magicians: Start with a copy of your program from Exercise 39. Write a function called
// make_great() that modifies the array of magicians by adding the phrase the Great to each magicianâ€™s
// name. Call show_magicians() to see that the list has actually been modified.

function show_Magicians(magicians:string[]){
    magicians.forEach(name => console.log(name)
    );
}

function make_great(magicians:string[]){
    return magicians.map(name => `The great ${name}`)
}

let magicians_names1 = ["Ali", "Ahmed", "Abid"]

let great_magicians = make_great(magicians_names1)
show_Magicians(great_magicians)
