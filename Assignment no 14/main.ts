//Guest List: If you could invite anyone, living or deceased, to dinner,
// who would you invite? Make a list that includes at least three people youâ€™d
// like to invite to dinner. Then use your list to print a message to each person,
// inviting them to dinner.

//Define array of guest
let guest_List:string[] = ["Amna", "Minhal", "Dua"];

//Invite each guest for dinner
//loop
for (let i = 0; i < guest_List.length;i++) {
    console.log(`Hey!${guest_List[i]} I would like to invite you to dinner`);
